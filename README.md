üìã Patch Notes ‚Äì Cards Archive Project
‚úÖ Core Features Implemented
Card Grid Display: Dynamic, responsive grid showing card image and price chart.

Full-Screen Card Viewer: Clicking a card opens a fullscreen modal with detailed info and price graph.

Edit/Delete Buttons: Cards can be modified or deleted directly from the viewer.

Price Chart: Line chart for card price history using Chart.js.

üîß Fixes & Improvements
Image + Chart Only Display in Grid: Simplified card preview to only show image and chart for clean layout.

Modal Activation Bug in WebView: Fixed touch/click issues by using position: relative and z-index tweaks for .card.

Full-Screen Modal Display: Ensured modal overlays correctly on all devices with proper z-index hierarchy.

Edit/Delete Modal Layering Fix: Increased z-index of edit modals to prevent them from being hidden behind view modals.

Graph Rendering Fix: Cleaned up empty graphs; ensured graph is destroyed properly when switching cards.

Price Validation: Prevented adding cards without at least one valid price entry.

Required Field Validation: All fields must be filled before a card can be added or saved.

Custom Alert System: Replaced browser alerts with custom modal-based alerts for consistent mobile/desktop UX.

Mobile Compatibility: Ensured all features (click, modals, alerts) work in Android WebView-based APK.

‚öôÔ∏è Under the Hood Enhancements
Dynamic Chart Rendering: Charts now initialize only when data is present; auto-clears on empty.

Unique Alert Class: Introduced .alert-modal class to avoid conflicts with other modals.

Improved User Feedback: Custom alerts guide users when adding incomplete cards.
